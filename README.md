# This is a basic structure for an e-commerce platform. You'll need to add more components, implement user authentication, create a shopping cart system, and add more features to make it fully functional. Also, make sure to set up environment variables for sensitive information like MongoDB URI and Stripe API keys.

- To complete the platform, you'll need to:

    Implement user authentication (login, register, logout)
    Create a shopping cart system
    Add more product details and search functionality
    Implement order management
    Add admin functionality for managing products and orders
    Improve the UI/UX with CSS and responsive design
    Implement proper error handling and form validation
    Set up Stripe webhook for handling successful payments

- Remember to follow best practices for security, such as input validation, CSRF protection, and secure storage of sensitive information.
